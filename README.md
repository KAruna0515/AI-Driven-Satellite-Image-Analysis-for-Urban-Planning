# AI-Driven-Satellite-Image-Analysis-for-Urban-Planning
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery to provide an automated, scalable, and efficient solution for urban planning challenges. By applying advanced deep learning techniques to high-resolution satellite images, the system can extract critical urban features such as buildings, roads, green.
